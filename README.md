## Introduction

**Travel Pace** is a straightforward module for Foundry VTT that helps calculate travel times for D&D 5E parties. Using the official rules from the SRD (pg.84), this module makes
it easy to determine how long your party's journey will take based on their speed and terrain conditions.

## Features

- **Simple Calculation**: Input distance and get travel time based on party speed
- **Terrain Consideration**: Automatically accounts for difficult terrain
- **Party Speed**: Uses the lowest speed in the party for accurate calculations
- **Rule Compliance**: Follows official D&D 5E travel pace rules
- **Easy Interface**: Simple, intuitive controls for quick calculations
- **Configurable Settings**: Support for metric conversion and forced march rules
- **Chat Integration**: Detailed travel information sent to chat

## Installation

Install directly through Foundry's module manager or manually using this manifest URL:
`https://github.com/Sayshal/travel-pace/releases/latest/download/module.json`

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. Select the tokens of your traveling party members
2. Click the Travel Pace button in the basic control bar
3. Input your travel distance for both normal and difficult terrain
4. Select terrain type (road/trail or difficult terrain)
5. Choose your speed ratio (Normal, 1/2, 1/4, or 1/6)
6. Get your calculated travel time instantly

### Settings Configuration

- **Forced March on Chat**: Toggle display of forced march rules in chat
- **Convert to Metric System**: Support for metric measurement systems

### Speed Ratio Options

- Normal (SRD) → 3 mi/h
- 1/2 Normal → 1.5 mi/h
- 1/4 Normal → 0.75 mi/h
- 1/6 Normal → 0.5 mi/h (Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden rules)

## Tips

- Always use the lowest movement speed in your group for calculations
- Consider any terrain without a road or trail as difficult terrain
- Remember players can only travel 8 hours per day without forced march
- Calculations follow the official rules from pg.84 of the SRD
